  Velur was created as a solution to everyone's clothing problems.
  Anyone can buy and sell their clothes on Velur.
  It also encourages people not to buy new ones from huge brands.

  Presently, the fashion industry is producing huge amounts of cheap, almost worthless pieces of apparel, all of it while neglecting workers' lives.
  Most of the clothes we are wearing come from poor countries which are taken advantage of by brands that only value profit.
  <br>
  <br>
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_impact_of_fashion" target="_blank">Pollution</a> is another issue.
  Manufacturing "one-time" shirts has lead to people barely wearing them for more than a month and simply throwing the clothes into garbage piles, thus creating an unsustainable cycle.
  <br>
  <br>
  We need to care more about the environment.
  <br>
  We need to conserve our planet.
